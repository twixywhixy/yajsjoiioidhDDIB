            <h1>To My butterfly</h1>
            <p>Hey my prettiest Hayfa,</p>
            <p>
                I’ve written this for you from the bottom of my heart. This isn’t just a text or butter-up letter, it’s everything I’ve ever felt for you and everything I’ve had since we started talking. I hope this makes you think how valuable you are and remind you how special you are. You mean the world to me, and I want you to know how much I love and appreciate you.
            </p>
            <p>
                You came into my life in such an unexpected way, like the most beautiful surprise. I did have a crush on you when you sent me that very first pic, I felt something special about you. It was like the universe was giving me the best gift ever, and I couldn’t believe how pretty you are. I still remember how you made me feel that day, it was 16:51 in the evening I was sitting on the sofa after a long day, my phone was under the sofa and all of a sudden I hear a notification from Snapchat, turns out it's someone called "Hayfa🪐". And I was being dry cos I wasn't in a mood to text you or anything I was jus minding my own business not knowing what you were holding for me, how silly! I still remember that first pic you sent me (A 5'3" ish tall girl, light black and ocean eyes which made me blush and smile at myself) that was the first ever impression about you and I had a crush on you from that moment itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was always thinking about you around the 2nd week it’s always about you, what you're doing, did you eat, were you okay and so on. It’s like my mood depends on you and that’s when I know that I’m attached to you mentally and everything revolves around you. You’ve never let me down or disappointed me, you’ve always been the best girl and I’m so happy to have you by my side. I will always feel proud and happy cos I added you on a random day and you became the best in my life. You entered my life at a time when I was at my lowest, and you pulled me out of the worst phase just by being yourself, you were jus being you just a chill girl with her playlist and Cat. You’ve been my light and hope ever since. I’ll forever be grateful for that. I’ve never met someone who could understand me so deeply in such a short period and it’s like you know me better than I know myself so soon, you gave me good sleep and peace I was needing that to be honest most importantly you gave me confidence and courage which made me walk like I'm the main character. You really helped me play good football and get so much better in every aspect.
            </p>
            <p>
                You’re my butterfly, my hayaati, my everything. Your smile can litch make my day better it's so cute when you smile those little dimple kind of thing on your cheeks, eyes going all squashy and small, tooth aligning so perfect and in shape I love that. When I hear your voice it's so soothing your accent is so nice and that licth gave me butterflies when I first heard you. I don't even wanna talk about your English, it's so perfect and much better than mine, the way you pronounce words, grammar, vocabulary it's top notch and great to hear. I love every small detail about it's so attractive you know.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your beauty is something that I could write a book on. It’s not just about how gorgeous you are on the outside, it's everything your face, your eyes, and your smile always makes me think of stars and moons and how they shine. You know when you look at the sky and stars you see that glow and you get some kind of happiness innit that's what how I feel. I like your curves, neck, shoulders, arms, legs, thighs, your personality the way you treat others, your kindness, your patience, and your sense of humour, how reassuring you are, the way you respect others. Everything about you di my Maadu you never know how much valuable you are there'll be around 1000 girls that would wanna have everything you do it's so perfect and you're so pretty. Do you even know how clean and shiny is your skin forget about breakouts it happens to every woman cos of period and phases that's litch normal but what's not normal is a clean natural skin, a girl who could slay without makeup and whatsoever. Everything about you is just so perfect to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Baby, I promise to you I will always be there for you, no matter what. Life will throw challenges at us, but I’m ready to face them all with you by my side doesn't matter if it's low and high, some days would be so annoying, we would feel so shit, we could have arguments, misunderstandings, fights and whatsoever. Personally, you could feel weak at times, you could have so much shit inside you and you might not share with me all of this could happen. There's always ups and downs but I wanna share and handle everything together, I wanna make decisions together and not turn back. Whether you’re having the best day or the worst, I’ll be right there, holding your hand and helping you through it, my love for you will never go less, no matter what life throws at us let's handle together hayaati. I wanna be there to see you achieve all your dreams and help you smash them. You being the most beautiful woman, perfect daughter, sister and girlfriend is bigger than everything. But I'm pretty sure you have dreams and goals to achieve to make your parents and everyone else proud. I don't wanna be an obstacle but I wanna be a supporting boyfriend and I wanna see you happy throughout our journey. I just want to create a life with you that’s full of love, happiness, and our chill vibes as usual.
            </p>
            <p>
                You’ve always wanted me to love myself, to believe in myself, and to see the beauty in confidence and its impact. You’ve helped me become a better version of myself, and I’ll always be thankful for that. You really brought out the best version of myself I was never this yapping I'm always quiet and nonchalant unless I'm comfortable with someone but I FW you very heavy I jus wanna be the best man for you.
